# How we took into account feedback 

When evaluating the pull request, we tested his code to make sure that the functionality that he added integrated well with our code. We found some issues and additional bugs in the code based on the new additions. We encountered difficulty in debugging the new code since the changes he made involved new ways of testing. 

He  implemented a Flask server so that we could connect the Python code to the HTML. This added the functionality of running Python code inside the Blockly window, but we encountered various problems when testing this. The code did not run successfully and we were not able to diagnose the errors that came up, since there was limited documentation and error tracing in the Python files provided. Since his pull request added a Docker image, we had various issues when making changes to the files in order to fix the new bugs. We had to rebuild the image and recreate the Docker container every time we wanted to make a change. We also determined that the addition of a Docker image does not align with our project's goals. We wanted to make machine learning accessible to all, and limiting implementation with a Docker container limits the amount of people who would be able to use our project to those who understand Docker. 

One issue that was raised that was not fixed in the pull request was a bug in our code where we had an extra parenthesis on the outside of our import statements when using the print data block. We were able to fix this issue by changing the code for the print data block to mimic that of other blocks that previously had the same issue. This change is now fixed and pushed to the repository
