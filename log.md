# How we divided up work
Explain how you divided the work between group members

Since we are using Blockly for this project, we decided to distribute each section of blocks to each person. People in the group who are most familiar with Machine Learning concepts were assigned the more complicated blocks to implement.

Minna was assigned the "Clean Data" section.

# Links to each group member's work 
Each group member should have one or more links to the files that contain the respective work

# Our use of AI 

We mainly used AI to help debug errors that we weren't able to understand. Creating and putting together blocks required us to make sure that each block was accepting and outputting the correct types. AI was able to help us identify potential errors in data types.
