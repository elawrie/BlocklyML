## Instructions 

- Open the index.html file in the src directory
- Drag blocks following the ML workflow, imitating the image on our slides linked in docs/BlocklyWorkflow.png
    - Feel free to test different combinations of code with the various dropdown menus we implemented (for different models, methods of evaluation, train/test split ratio, etc.)
- To run the code, open a Google Colab workspace through Google Drive and copy/paste the code created from the Generate Python or Save Code buttons 
    - When generating Data Visualizations, make sure to put this code in its own code cell so that the graph appears on the screen
